BIRDBRAIN by Jamie Paige

So- fuck
So unsure, before it's even heard
Never confident in a single word
This bird, expert in the absurd
Number one in life that has been deferred
It hurts this relentless introvert
But inversion only serves to put deserving on the mind
So I keep my time, so far out of line
And when the day turns night, I can't help but

Cry so loudly, I slant devoutly
Tell me what about me is built so wrong?
There's so much passion
But more I'm lacking
I wish that I could c-c-c-c-c-c-c-caw-

But I falter on the forethought
I keep on running like a chicken with its head cut off
Achromatic twisted aeronaut
A birdbrain, baby, I don't know when I'm supposed to stop
Hit me with the flap down, crash into the soft ground (foul)
Ain't no fellow feathers falling for a freak (so weak)
So put my neck up on the chopping block
A birdbrain, baby, I don't think my head is coming off
Baby, I don't know when I'm supposed to stop
Baby, I don't know when I'm supposed to stop
